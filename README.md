Building
--------

The building system uses scons.  You can compile in debug with 'scons', and in
release with 'scons mode=release'.  On Windows, currently possible to build
with [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) or try prebuilt
[goxel](https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-goxel) package directly.
The code is in C99, using some gnu extensions, so it does not compile
with msvc.

# Linux/BSD

Install dependencies using your package manager.  On Debian/Ubuntu:

    - scons
    - pkg-config
    - libglfw3-dev
    - libgtk-3-dev

Then to build, run the command:

    make release

# Windows

You need to install msys2 mingw, and the following packages:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libtre-git
    pacman -S scons
    pacman -S make

Then to build:

    make release
