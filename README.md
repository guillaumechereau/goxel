Building
--------

The building system uses scons.  You can compile in debug with 'scons', and in
release with 'scons debug=0'.  On Windows, I only tried to build with msys2.
The code is in C99, using some gnu extensions, so it does not compile with
msvc.

# Linux

Install dependencies: scons pkg-config libglfw3-dev libgtk-3-dev

Then to build:

    make release

# Windows

You need to install msys2 mingw, and the following packages:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libtre-git
    pacman -S scons
    pacman -S make

Then to build:

    make release
